    <h2> JavaScript란 무엇인가? </h2>
    <p>
       JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, interpreted programming language.<br>
       It is a language which is also characterized as dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based and multi-paradigm.<br>
       Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of the World Wide Web.<br>
       JavaScript enables interactive web pages and thus is an essential part of web applications.<br>
       The vast majority of websites use it, and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.
