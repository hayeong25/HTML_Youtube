    <h1> HTML </h1>
    <p>
        HyperText Markup Language(HTML) is the standard markup language for <strong> creating <u>web</u> pages </strong> and web applications.<br>
        Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render them into multimedia web pages.<br>
        HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.

        HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages.<br>
        With HTML constructs, images and other objects, such as interactive forms, may be embedded into the rendered page.<br>
        It provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items.<br>
        HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.
